Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?  
   Runtime doesn't grow relative to the input so it's Constant time:  
   O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?  
   O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?  
   Worst case is that it performs an operation for every item in the storage list, so it is Linear time:  
   O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?  
   O(n)

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
